I"ý<p>Hello! Since the fall of 2020, I have been working on my Ph.D. in Computer Science at the University of Michigan. I am privileged to be a part of the <a href="https://lit.eecs.umich.edu/">LIT research group</a>, being advised by <a href="https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~mihalcea/">Professor Rada Mihalcea</a>.</p>

<p>Broadly, my research is around computational and statistical models for natural language, and applying them to understand social phenomena. Currently, I am working in the mental health domain: How do we build computational models to understand or represent human emotion, and how do we measure nuanced concepts like empathy?</p>

<p>I am also interested in language modeling and understanding its reasoning capabilities. Specifically, I am interested in understanding its inner representations of belief-states of the world and how they are used during its decision making process.</p>

<p>During the summer of 2022, I worked at <a href="https://ai.facebook.com/">Meta AI</a> and demonstrated how to integrate a language model with symbolic reasoning agents like AlphaZero to generate grounded and strategically sound chess commentaries (<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.08195.pdf">Preprint</a>).
During the summer of 2021, I worked at Microsoft Research â€“ as part of the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/ktx/">Knowledge Technologies and Intelligent Experiences Team (KTX)</a>, I designed and built a single framework that handles multiple tasks in the Community Question Answering domain.
Prior to starting my Ph.D. program, I led the Core AI R&amp;D team at <a href="https://clinc.com/">Clinc</a>, a startup based in Ann Arbor MI, where we built and deployed virtual assistants and conversational AI platforms for financial institutions.</p>
