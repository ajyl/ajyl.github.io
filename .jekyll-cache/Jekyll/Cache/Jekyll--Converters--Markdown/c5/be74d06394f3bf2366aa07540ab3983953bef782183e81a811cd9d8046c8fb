I"®<p>Hello! I am a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at the University of Michigan. I am priviledged to be a part of the <a href="https://lit.eecs.umich.edu/">LIT research group</a>, being advised by <a href="https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~mihalcea/">Professor Rada Mihalcea</a>.</p>

<p>My research is mostly around computational and statistical models for understanding natural language as well as social phenomena. Currently, I am interested in building intelligent dialogue systems that can guide users in completing their tasks. This entails a lot of interesting questions â€“ How do we best represent user utterances and dialogue states? How can we explain the behavior of these systems? And how can these systems adapt to new domains?</p>

<p>During the summer of 2021, I was a research intern at Microsoft Research. As part of the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/ktx/">Knowledge Technologies and Intelligent Experiences Team (KTX)</a>, I designed and built a single framework that handles multiple tasks in the Community Question Answering domain. Prior to starting my Ph.D. program, I led the Core AI R&amp;D team at <a href="https://clinc.com/">Clinc</a>, a startup based in Ann Arbor MI, where we built and deployed virtual assistants and conversational AI platforms for financial institutions. Our research team was responsible for publishing our findings as well as bringing the newest technology into our products.</p>
