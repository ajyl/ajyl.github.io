Hello! Since the fall of 2020, I have been working on my Ph.D. in Computer Science at the University of Michigan. I am privileged to be a part of the [LIT research group](https://lit.eecs.umich.edu/), being advised by [Professor Rada Mihalcea](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~mihalcea/).

Broadly, my research is around computational and statistical models for natural language, and applying them to understand social phenomena. Currently, I am working in the mental health domain: How do we build computational models to understand or represent human emotion, and how do we measure nuanced concepts like empathy?

I am also interested in language modeling and understanding its reasoning capabilities. Specifically, I am interested in understanding its inner representations of belief-states of the world and how they are used during its decision making process.

During the summer of 2022, I worked at [Meta AI](https://ai.facebook.com/) and demonstrated how to integrate a language model with symbolic reasoning agents like AlphaZero to generate grounded and strategically sound chess commentaries ([Preprint](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.08195.pdf)).
During the summer of 2021, I worked at Microsoft Research -- as part of the [Knowledge Technologies and Intelligent Experiences Team (KTX)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/ktx/), I designed and built a single framework that handles multiple tasks in the Community Question Answering domain.
Prior to starting my Ph.D. program, I led the Core AI R&D team at [Clinc](https://clinc.com/), a startup based in Ann Arbor MI, where we built and deployed virtual assistants and conversational AI platforms for financial institutions.
