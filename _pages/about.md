**I am looking for a post-doc position starting in the summer/fall of 2024. I am interested in mechanistic interpretability. If you see me as a good fit, please email me at ajyl[at]umich.edu.**

Hello! I am a PhD candidate at the University of Michigan, working on machine learning + natural language processing. I am privileged to be a part of the [LIT research group](https://lit.eecs.umich.edu/), being advised by [Professor Rada Mihalcea](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~mihalcea/).

Currently, I am interested in mechanistically understanding how language models work, as well as interpreting the inner representations that they use. For instance, I have studied the representation of [world models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00941) in self-supervised sequence models.

I have been fortunate to collaborate with multiple teams in industry. During the summers of 2023 and 2022, I interned at Meta AI (Reasoning, Attention, Memory team and Diplomacy team), while in the summer of 2021 I worked at Microsoft Research. My collaborators include Neel Nanda (DeepMind), Jason Weston, Sainbayar Sukhbaatar, Mike Lewis, Emily Dinan, Jing Xu (Meta AI), and Silviu Cucerzan (Microsoft Research).  

Prior to my Ph.D. program, I led the Core AI R&D team at [Clinc](https://clinc.com/), a startup based in Ann Arbor MI, where we built and deployed virtual assistants and conversational AI platforms for financial institutions.
