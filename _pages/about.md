I am a post-doctoral fellow at the [Insight + Interaction Lab](https://insight.seas.harvard.edu/) at Harvard, hosted by professors [Martin Wattenberg](https://www.bewitched.com/) and [Fernanda Vi√©gas](http://www.fernandaviegas.com/).

I did my PhD in computer science at the University of Michigan, advised by [Professor Rada Mihalcea](https://lit.eecs.umich.edu/).

My research interests are in machine learning and natural language processing. I am particularly interested in understanding the representations learned by neural networks, and how they can be used to improve the interpretability and robustness of AI systems.

During my PhD, I spent time at [Meta AI](https://ai.meta.com/), once on the Reasoning, Attention, and Memory team (Advised by Jing Xu, [Jason Weston](https://www.thespermwhale.com/jaseweston/)), and once on the [Diplomacy team](https://ai.meta.com/research/cicero/) (Advised by [Emily Dinan](https://ai.meta.com/people/767581351981566/emily-dinan/), [Mike Lewis](https://ai.meta.com/people/209431298931133/mike-lewis/)). I have also spent time at [Microsoft Research](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/) on the [Knowledge Technologies and Intelligent Experiences (KTX)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/ktx/) team advised by [Silviu-Petru Cucerzan](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/silviu/).
Prior to the PhD, I led the Core AI R&D team at [Clinc](https://clinc.com/), where we built virtual assistants and conversational AI platforms for financial institutions.

When I am not reverse-engineering neural networks, I enjoy playing tennis and rowing.
