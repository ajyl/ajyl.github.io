Hello! I am a post-doctoral fellow at the [Insight + Interaction Lab](https://insight.seas.harvard.edu/) at Harvard, hosted by professors [Martin Wattenberg](https://www.bewitched.com/) and [Fernanda Viégas](http://www.fernandaviegas.com/).

I did my PhD in computer science at the University of Michigan, advised by [Professor Rada Mihalcea](https://lit.eecs.umich.edu/).
Prior to the PhD, I led the Core AI R&D team at [Clinc](https://clinc.com/), where we built virtual assistants and conversational AI platforms for financial institutions.

Currently, I am interested in reverse-engineering neural networks, and understanding their inner representations.
