I"Þ<p><em>I am looking for a post-doc position starting in the summer/fall of 2024. I am interested in mechanistic interpretability. If you see me as a good fit, please email me at ajyl[at]umich.edu.</em></p>

<p>Hello! I am a PhD candidate at the University of Michigan, working on machine learning + natural language processing. I am privileged to be a part of the <a href="https://lit.eecs.umich.edu/">LIT research group</a>, being advised by <a href="https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~mihalcea/">Professor Rada Mihalcea</a>.</p>

<p>Currently, I am interested in mechanistically understanding how language models work, as well as interpreting the inner representations that they use. For instance, I have studied the representation of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00941">world models</a> in self-supervised sequence models.</p>

<p>I have been fortunate to collaborate with multiple teams in industry. During the summers of 2023 and 2022, I interned at Meta AI (Reasoning, Attention, Memory team and Diplomacy team), while in the summer of 2021 I worked at Microsoft Research. My collaborators include Neel Nanda (DeepMind), Jason Weston, Sainbayar Sukhbaatar, Mike Lewis, Emily Dinan, Jing Xu (Meta AI), and Silviu Cucerzan (Microsoft Research).</p>

<p>Prior to my Ph.D. program, I led the Core AI R&amp;D team at <a href="https://clinc.com/">Clinc</a>, a startup based in Ann Arbor MI, where we built and deployed virtual assistants and conversational AI platforms for financial institutions.</p>
