I"‡<p>Hello! I am a post-doc researcher at <a href="https://insight.seas.harvard.edu/">Insight + Interaction Lab</a> at Harvard, hosted by <a href="https://www.bewitched.com/">Martin Wattenberg</a> and <a href="http://www.fernandaviegas.com/">Fernanda Vi√©gas</a>.</p>

<p>I did my PhD in computer science at the University of Michigan, advised by <a href="https://lit.eecs.umich.edu/">Professor Rada Mihalcea</a>.
Prior to the PhD, I led the Core AI R&amp;D team at <a href="https://clinc.com/">Clinc</a>, where we built virtual assistants and conversational AI platforms for financial institutions.</p>

<p>Currently, I am interested in understanding the mechanisms of neural networks, and interpreting their inner representations.</p>
