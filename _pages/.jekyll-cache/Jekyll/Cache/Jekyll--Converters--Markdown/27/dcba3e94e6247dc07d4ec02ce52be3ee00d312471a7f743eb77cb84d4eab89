I"–<p>Hello! Since the fall of 2020, I have been working on my Ph.D. in Computer Science at the University of Michigan. I am privileged to be a part of the <a href="https://lit.eecs.umich.edu/">LIT research group</a>, being advised by <a href="https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~mihalcea/">Professor Rada Mihalcea</a>.</p>

<p>Broadly, my research is around computational and statistical models for natural language, and applying them to understand social phenomena. Currently, I am interested in developing models that are applicable in the mental health domain. This includes a wide range of interesting challenges. How can we identify unhealthy thoughts, such as cognitive distortions? How do we build computational models to understand human emotion, and how do we measure nuanced concepts like empathy?</p>

<p>During the summer of 2022, I worked at <a href="https://ai.facebook.com/">Meta AI</a> and demonstrated how to ground a language model by integrating it with a symbolic reasoning agent like AlphaZero to do chess commentary generation (<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.08195.pdf">Preprint</a>).
During the summer of 2021, I was a research intern at Microsoft Research. As part of the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/ktx/">Knowledge Technologies and Intelligent Experiences Team (KTX)</a>, I designed and built a single framework that handles multiple tasks in the Community Question Answering domain.
Prior to starting my Ph.D. program, I led the Core AI R&amp;D team at <a href="https://clinc.com/">Clinc</a>, a startup based in Ann Arbor MI, where we built and deployed virtual assistants and conversational AI platforms for financial institutions.</p>
